# 5Friends
This was my first attempt at coding for IOS. The app allows you to talk to anonymous people in a group chat of 5. 

It took me 2 days to code the core functions and 1 month to make it launchable.

Here is the link to download it on Itunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/5friends/id1000355114?mt=8

I used firebase as the realtime backend and parse for my push notification.
